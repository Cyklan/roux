# Roux

Roux is a template for a Rust-Powered HTMX fullstack application.

The tech stack includes:

- [x] rust (obviously)
- [x]HTMx (also obviously)
- [x] Askama templating engine
- [x] Tailwind
- [x] Lit.js (web components)
- [ ] PosgreSQL

## Get Started

To get started with Roux, click the `Use this Template` button in the top right of this repository.
To run it locally, you'll need Node.js (to run vite for bundling) and rust (to run the server).
Using web components is totally optional, but if there is some sort of dynamic interaction you can't (or don't want to) represent with a template file, they're there for you. If you're using VSCode, install the [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) extension for better syntax highlighting.
